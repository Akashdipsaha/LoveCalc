# LoveCalc
This is a simple love calculator web application that takes in two names as input - one is the name of the user, and the other is the name of their crush. 
Upon clicking the "calculate" button, the function calculate() is triggered, which generates a random number between 1 and 100, and assigns it to the variable lovescore. 
Based on the value of lovescore, the function then generates a message that reflects the compatibility of the two names.

If the yourName or crushName variables are empty, the function displays an alert message requesting the user to input both names. 
If lovescore is greater than 70, the message displayed will indicate that the two names are meant to be together. If lovescore is between 30 and 70, 
the message displayed will indicate that there is a decent chance of making it work. If lovescore is less than 30, 
the message displayed will indicate that the two names are not a match.

Finally, the result is displayed on the webpage using the innerHTML property, which assigns the value of lovescore to the result element on the webpage.
Overall it's a retro love calculator for the love bodies from the early twenty-first century, and it's a simple and entertaining tool for determining the compatibility of two names. 
Users can indeed find entertainment and delight from it even if it's not scientifically true.
